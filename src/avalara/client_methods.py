    Reset this account's license key
    
    Resets the existing license key for this account to a new key.
      To reset your account, you must specify the ID of the account you wish to reset and confirm the action.
      This API is only available to account administrators for the account in question, and may only be called after
      an account has been activated by reading and accepting Avalara's terms and conditions. To activate your account
      please log onto the AvaTax website or call the `ActivateAccount` API.
      You can only reset license with 'Default' license key name.
      Resetting a license key cannot be undone. Any previous license keys will immediately cease to work when a new key is created.
      When you call this API, all account administrators for this account will receive an email with the newly updated license key.
      The email will specify which user reset the license key and it will contain the new key to use to update your connectors.
      Note: The reset license key functionality will only be available for existing active license key i.e. when you reset license key for the account, the Default license key will be reset.The reset license key functionality is not available for newly created license keys i.e. license keys other than Default

    Unlink attributes from a customer
    
    Unlink one or many attributes from a customer.
      A customer may have multiple attributes that control its behavior. You may link or unlink attributes to a
      customer at any time. The full list of defined attributes may be found using `QueryCompanyCustomerAttributes` API.
      A customer object defines information about a person or business that purchases products from your
      company. When you create a tax transaction in AvaTax, you can use the `customerCode` from this
      record in your `CreateTransaction` API call. AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and
      identify any certificates linked to this customer object. If any certificate applies to the transaction,
      AvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.
      Before you can use any exemption certificates endpoints, you must set up your company for exemption certificate data storage.
      Companies that do not have this storage system set up will see `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
      certificate related APIs. To check if this is set up for a company, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of exemption
      certificate storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.

    Retrieve status about a funding setup request
    
    This API is available by invitation only.
      Companies that use the Avalara Managed Returns or the SST Certified Service Provider services are
      required to setup their funding configuration before Avalara can begin filing tax returns on their
      behalf.
      Funding configuration for each company is set up by submitting a funding setup request, which can
      be sent either via email or via an embedded HTML widget.
      When the funding configuration is submitted to Avalara, it will be reviewed by treasury team members
      before approval.
      This API checks the status on an existing funding request.
      This API requires a subscription to Avalara Managed Returns or SST Certified Service Provider.

    Get audit information about a MultiDocument transaction
    
    Retrieve audit information about a MultiDocument transaction stored in AvaTax.
      The audit API retrieves audit information related to a specific MultiDocument transaction. This audit
      information includes the following:
      * The `code` of the MultiDocument transaction
      * The `type` of the MultiDocument transaction
      * The server timestamp representing the exact server time when the transaction was created
      * The server duration - how long it took to process this transaction
      * Whether exact API call details were logged
      * A reconstructed API call showing what the original create call looked like
      A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
      sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).

    Create a new MultiDocument transaction
    
    Records a new MultiDocument transaction in AvaTax.
      A traditional transaction requires exactly two parties: a seller and a buyer. MultiDocument transactions can
      involve a marketplace of vendors, each of which contributes some portion of the final transaction. Within
      a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate
      document. This separation of documents allows each seller to file their taxes separately.
      This API will report an error if you attempt to create a transaction when one already exists with the specified `code`.
      If you would like the API to automatically update the transaction when it already exists, please set the `allowAdjust`
      value to `true`.
      To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
      The field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund. If you do not specify
      a `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.
      The origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode. For address-based transactions, please
      provide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`. For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode
      information in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`. If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated
      using the best available address location information.
      You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:
      * Lines
      * Details (implies lines)
      * Summary (implies details)
      * Addresses
      * SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
      * LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
      * ForceTimeout - Simulates a timeout. This adds a 30 second delay and error to your API call. This can be used to test your code to ensure it can respond correctly in the case of a dropped connection.
      If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

      for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction. You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
      specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.
      The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
      was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
      nexus, or any other setting.
      This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following
      common refund scenarios:
      * A full refund of a previous sale
      * Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
      * Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
      * Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale

      create a custom refund transaction.

    Void a MultiDocument transaction
    
    Voids the current transaction uniquely identified by this URL.
      A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
      sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).
      When you void a transaction, that transaction's status is recorded as `DocVoided`.
      Transactions that have been previously reported to a tax authority by Avalara Managed Returns Service are considered `locked`,
      and they are no longer available to be voided.
      NOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:
      * Replace '/' with '\_-ava2f-\_' For example: document/Code becomes document_-ava2f-_Code
      * Replace '+' with '\_-ava2b-\_' For example: document+Code becomes document_-ava2b-_Code
      * Replace '?' with '\_-ava3f-\_' For example: document?Code becomes document_-ava3f-_Code
      * Replace '%' with '\_-ava25-\_' For example: document%Code becomes document_-ava25-_Code
      * Replace '#' with '\_-ava23-\_' For example: document#Code becomes document_-ava23-_Code

    Create a new nexus
    
    Creates one or more new nexus declarations attached to this company.
      The concept of Nexus indicates a place where your company is legally obligated to collect and remit transactional
      taxes. The legal requirements for nexus may vary per country and per jurisdiction; please seek advice from your
      accountant or lawyer prior to declaring nexus.
      To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
      list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
      only the user-selectable fields in this object.
      The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
      `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
      When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
      must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
      by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.
      Please note that nexus changes may not take effect immediately and you should plan to update your nexus settings in advance
      of calculating tax for a location.

    Retrieve parameters for a nexus
    
    List parameters for a nexus.
      Some tax calculation and reporting are different depending on the properties of the nexus, such as isRemoteSeller. In AvaTax, these tax-affecting properties are called "parameters".
      A parameter added to an nexus will be used by default in tax calculation but will not show on the transaction line referencing the nexus.
      A parameter specified on a transaction line will override an nexus parameter if they share the same parameter name.

      taxes. The legal requirements for nexus may vary per country and per jurisdiction; please seek advice from your
      accountant or lawyer prior to declaring nexus.
      To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
      list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
      only the user-selectable fields in this object.
      The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
      `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
      When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
      must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
      by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.

      rate and the final transaction tax.

      * COUNTY_SALES_TAX - The county component of the sales tax rate.
      * COUNTY_USE_TAX - The county component of the use tax rate.
      * CITY_SALES_TAX - The city component of the sales tax rate.
      * CITY_USE_TAX - The city component of the use tax rate.
      * TOTAL_SALES_TAX - The total tax rate for sales tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.
      * TOTAL_USE_TAX - The total tax rate for use tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.

    Retrieve tax rules for this company
    
    List all taxrule objects attached to this company.
      A tax rule represents a rule that changes the default AvaTax behavior for a product or jurisdiction. Custom tax rules
      can be used to change the taxability of an item, to change the tax base of an item, or to change the tax rate
      charged when selling an item. Tax rules can also change tax behavior depending on the `entityUseCode` value submitted
      with the transaction.
      You can create custom tax rules to customize the behavior of AvaTax to match specific rules that are custom to your
      business. If you have obtained a ruling from a tax auditor that requires custom tax calculations, you can use
      custom tax rules to redefine the behavior for your company or item.
      Please use custom tax rules carefully and ensure that these tax rules match the behavior agreed upon with your
      auditor, legal representative, and accounting team.
      Search for specific objects using the criteria in the `$filter` parameter; full documentation is available on [Filtering in REST](http://developer.avalara.com/avatax/filtering-in-rest/) .

    Create or adjust a transaction
    
    Records a new transaction or adjust an existing transaction in AvaTax.
      The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` endpoint is used to create a new transaction or update an existing one. This API
      can help you create an idempotent service that creates transactions
      If there exists a transaction identified by code, the original transaction will be adjusted by using the meta data
      in the input transaction.
      The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API cannot modify any transaction that has been reported to a tax authority using
      the Avalara Managed Returns Service or any other tax filing service. If you call this API to attempt to modify
      a transaction that has been reported on a tax filing, you will receive the error `CannotModifyLockedTransaction`.
      To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
      If you don't specify the field `type` in your request, you will get an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded in the database.
      A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
      sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).

    Create a new transaction
    
    Records a new transaction in AvaTax.
      A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
      sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).
      The `CreateTransaction` endpoint uses the tax profile of your company to identify the correct tax rules
      and rates to apply to all line items in this transaction. The end result will be the total tax calculated by AvaTax based on your
      company's configuration and the data provided in this API call.
      The `CreateTransaction` API will report an error if a committed transaction already exists with the same `code`. To
      avoid this error, use the `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API - it will create the transaction if it does not exist, or
      update it if it does exist.
      To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
      The field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund. If you do not specify
      a `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.
      The origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode. For address-based transactions, please
      provide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`. For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode
      information in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`. If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated
      using the best available address location information.

    Create a refund for a transaction
    
    Create a refund for a transaction.
      The `RefundTransaction` API allows you to quickly and easily create a `ReturnInvoice` representing a refund
      for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction. You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
      specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.
      The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
      was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
      nexus, or any other setting.
      This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following
      common refund scenarios:
      * A full refund of a previous sale
      * Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
      * Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
      * Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale
      For more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to
      create a custom refund transaction.
      You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:
      * Lines
      * Details (implies lines)
      * Summary (implies details)
      * Addresses
      * SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
      * LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
      * TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.
      If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.
      NOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:

    Check connectivity to AvaTax and return information about the AvaTax API server.
      This API is intended to help you verify that your connection is working. This API will always succeed and will
      never return a error. It provides basic information about the server you connect to:
      * `version` - The version number of the AvaTax API server that responded to your request. The AvaTax API version number is updated once per month during Avalara's update process.
      * `authenticated` - A boolean flag indicating whether or not you sent valid credentials with your API request.
      * `authenticationType` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you whether you used Bearer, Username, or LicenseKey authentication.
      * `authenticatedUserName` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the username of the currently logged in user.
      * `authenticatedUserId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the user ID of the currently logged in user.
      * `authenticatedAccountId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will contain the account ID of the currently logged in user.
      This API helps diagnose connectivity problems between your application and AvaTax; you may call this API even
      if you do not have verified connection credentials. If this API fails, either your computer is not connected to
      the internet, or there is a routing problem between your office and Avalara, or the Avalara server is not available.
